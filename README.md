# Internet use trajectories and long-term health outcomes among middle-aged and older adults in the United States, 2002 to 2019
# Project Descriptions
This project analyzes longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (2002-2019) to investigate how sustained internet usage patterns impact health outcomes in adults 50+. Using trajectory modeling and Cox regression, we identify five distinct internet use patterns and demonstrate that sustained/adopted usage associates with 37-44% lower mortality risk, reduced dementia incidence, and better mental health outcomes compared to non-users. Findings highlight digital engagement as a potential modifiable factor for healthy aging while underscoring persistent digital disparities. Analysis code, methodology, and supplementary materials included.
